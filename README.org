* Cheddar

*Cheddar* is a connected button based on the ESP8266.

** What is this ?

   Amazon created not a long time ago a connected button (called Dash
   button) that allows to make an order on Amazon just by pressing a
   single button facilitating the process of buying of household goods.
   It didn't take a long time before hackers started appropriating the
   object and use it for their own purposes:

   * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZpJ9W0wCks][How To Use the Amazon Dash with IFTTT and Home Assistant]]

   All that had to be done was to buy one, get the button ID through the
   Amazon app and encode that ID to _whatever_ was listening to the
   incoming query.  Amazon gave you a $5 connected piece of hardware,
   battery and case included that allowed you to do virtually anything
   with it.

   As amazing as this might sound, the problems of those buttons are:

   * You need an amazon premium account to purchase them and get the button ID.
   * You can't directly program them, which makes complex queries more
     difficult to run and embedding sensors impossible.
   * You need a server running somewhere locally to listen to the incoming queries.
   * You can't wake it up from external events other than by pressing the button.

** What to do ?

   Why not create our own open source "Amazon Dash button". It would
   also run on a battery, can be programmed and is
   Internet-connected. The ESP8266 microcontroller is used in a wide
   variety of projects and many frameworks are developed around + it's
   also really cheap !

   Powering an ESP8266 dev board (WEMOS D1, NodeMCU DevKit, Sparkfun
   ESP8266 Thing...) with a battery and waking it up when the button is
   pressed is quite a trivial problem and not fun. That's why I chose to
   create a PCB to host the ESP8266 module. Although it has some
   requirements:

   * Be able to program it and debug it from USB
   * Can run on batteries
   * Batteries should be rechargeable using the on board USB
   * It should be power efficient
